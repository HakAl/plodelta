Small react app to input your stats.

### TODOS
- How do PF ranges differ based on stake / rake structure?
- Additional commentary on analysis
- summaries
- user GTO stat input edit inline / file upload
- csv output download
- investigate DH integration
- investigate data viz lib like https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3
- general HM3 report gen? HM3 interface sucks
